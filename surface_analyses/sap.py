"""
More flexible implementation of the Spatial Aggregation Propensity (SAP)
algorithm.

Steps to do a SAP calculation:
    * load a structure. I use mdtraj for the SASA-related functions. The blur
      should be usable with any library, though.
    * assign hydrophobicity values to each atom. assign_propensities can be
      used for that.
    * compute the solvent-accessible surface (SAA), e.g., using
      mdtraj.shrake_rupley
    * Apply a blur. The default SAP algorithm uses a hard distance cutoff of 5
      Ã…. A weighting function can be used for blur, but this is not supported
      in the command line interface.

This implementation can be used from a script/Jupyter notebook, or via the
command line interface. The functionality of the CLI is limited, however. It
supports a single PDB input. The distance cutoff can be changed, but no
weighting functions are implemented.
